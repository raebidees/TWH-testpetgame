        <p>It was probably one of the legacy tools (or the seed swap shop, which is just seed swap since I got rid of the legacy one, find it on the main page). Unfortunately the recent refactor broke them, but they're not gone for good. I can redirect to an archived copy of them, but I needed to find out if anyone uses them first, so just drop by the thread and let me know. Or if you got here by a link in the current tool, let me know what broke. This is technically the 404 page.</p>
