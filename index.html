Once a plant (or animal, or rock...) pops up, hit the Home button in the top-left."],
    ["Congrats on your first plant!","Or 'plant'. We used to only have plants, but now we have everything from deer to magic crystals, you never know what you'll find. Let's go admire your new friend!<br><br>Click on Collection. It's got a lot going on, but for now let's focus on Analyze (the bigger picture of your plant) and Backup (tap the button to make a backup). Make a backup and hit Home when you're done."],
    ["Saving your progress","Progress is saved automatically, stored in your browser, and never sent anywhere. If you use many browsers/devices, the backup file you just made will let you sync progress between them. If you check out the Settings menu, there's an option for loading backups there, but you can also mess with the site's colors if you like. Next time you return to this page, I'll have some new plants for you!"],

If someone pastes that seed into their own collection, they'll get the exact same plant. Use seeds to share and trade! Copy the seeds below (commas and all), go to your Collection, hit the Add button, and paste them in.<br><br>D32UmCPUJQ, D5LzrCC883, C2cN1COiq7, D3pckB+mgC, C4tEvCFBek"],

If you ever get a plant you don't like, just go to your collection, hit Recycle, tap the plant(s), then 'Recycle Seeds'. That'll trade them for some RS, which you can swap for new plants or use to alter ones you already have. You'll get RS other ways too, like clearings tasks off the To-Do list and bingo boards. Come back here when you have 15 RS! You can check your total in the Collection."],

For now let's just unlock some more ways to earn plants. The general Bingo board is very powerful, and many people's main way of getting seeds. Bits 'n Bobs is for you creative types, and you can get your own 'personal' seed there either way in the second thingy. See you back here in 5 more plants..."],
    ["The garden", "Congratulations, your collection's large enough for a garden! The Garden Creator lets you arrange your plants in all sorts of ways. It can get fairly in-depth, but an easy way to start is hitting the Randomize button several times. You'll see layers popping up on the right-hand side, click-drag those to reorder and see what happens. The best way to learn the garden creator is by playing with it!"],
